                <h2>Scenario</h2>
                <p>Marco, a passenger waiting for his daughter's delayed flight, feels stressed and confused due to lack of updates. Clear, empathetic communication can help him feel supported.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Flight delays cause stress and uncertainty.</p>
                <p><strong>User Goal:</strong> Gain accurate updates and reassurance.</p>
                <p><strong>Business Goal:</strong> Provide clear information to improve passenger satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Flight updates often feel impersonal and cold, ignoring the stress passengers face during delays.
            By providing clear, empathetic messages like, <em>"Weâ€™re sorry for the delay to your flight. Please continue to monitor the airport screens and check the Flight Tracker for updates,"</em>
            passengers feel informed and supported.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few thoughtful words can reassure waiting passengers and reduce anxiety, improving overall passenger satisfaction.
