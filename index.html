                <h2>Flight Delayed Messages</h2>
                <p>Airports and flight details can be confusing. With a friendly tone and simple words, this project shows how better messages can ease stress for passengers.</p>

                <h2>Scenario</h2>
                <p>Marco, a passenger waiting for his daughter's delayed flight, feels stressed and confused due to lack of updates. Clear, empathetic communication can help him feel supported.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Flight delays cause stress and uncertainty.</p>
                <p><strong>User Goal:</strong> Gain accurate updates and reassurance.</p>
                <p><strong>Business Goal:</strong> Provide clear information to improve passenger satisfaction.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>Flight updates often feel impersonal and cold, ignoring the stress and doubts passengers face during delays. By adding clear and friendly messages like, "Weâ€™re sorry for the delay to your flight. Please continue to monitor the airport screens and check the Flight Tracker for updates," passengers feel reassured and informed about the situation.</p>
