                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>Flight updates often feel impersonal and cold, ignoring the stress and doubts of passengers. Clear, empathetic messaging such as "We're sorry for the delay to your flight. Please monitor the airport screens and check the Flight Tracker for updates" can provide clarity and reassurance.</p>
