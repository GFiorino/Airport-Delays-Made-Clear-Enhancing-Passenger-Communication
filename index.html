                <h2>Flight Delayed Messages</h2>
                <p>Flight details can be overwhelming and unclear during delays. With a friendly tone and simple words, this project shows how better messages can ease stress for passengers.</p>

                <h2>Scenario</h2>
                <p>Marco, a passenger waiting for his daughter's delayed flight, feels stressed and confused due to lack of updates. Clear, empathetic communication can help him feel supported.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Flight delays cause stress and uncertainty.</p>
                <p><strong>User Goal:</strong> Gain accurate updates and reassurance.</p>
                <p><strong>Business Goal:</strong> Provide clear information to improve passenger satisfaction.</p>

                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>Flight updates often feel impersonal and cold, ignoring the passenger's stress and doubts. A simple message like, "We're sorry for the delay to your flight. Please check airport screens for updates," gives a sense of reassurance and clarity.</p>
