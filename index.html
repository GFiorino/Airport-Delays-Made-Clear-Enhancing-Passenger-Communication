                <h2>Flight Delayed Messages</h2>
                <p>Flight details can be overwhelming and unclear during delays. With a friendly tone and simple words, this project shows how better messages can ease stress for passengers.</p>

                <h2>Scenario</h2>
                <p>Marco, a passenger waiting for his daughter’s delayed flight, feels stressed and confused due to lack of updates. Clear, empathetic communication can help him feel supported.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Flight delays cause stress and uncertainty.</p>
                <p><strong>User Goal:</strong> Gain accurate updates and reassurance.</p>
                <p><strong>Business Goal:</strong> Provide clear information to improve passenger satisfaction.</p>

                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>Flight updates often feel impersonal and cold, ignoring the doubts and stress of waiting passengers. By providing clear, friendly messages such as, "We’re sorry for the delay to your flight. Please continue to monitor the airport screens and check the Flight Tracker for updates," passengers feel reassured and supported.</p>
