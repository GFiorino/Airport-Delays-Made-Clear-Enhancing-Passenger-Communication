                <h2>Flight Delayed Messages</h2>
                <p>Flight details can be overwhelming and unclear during delays. With a friendly tone and simple words, this project shows how better messages can ease stress for passengers.</p>

                <h2>Scenario</h2>
                <p>Marco, a passenger waiting for his daughter's delayed flight, feels stressed and confused due to lack of updates. Clear, empathetic communication can help him feel supported.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Flight delays cause stress and uncertainty.</p>
                <p><strong>User Goal:</strong> Gain accurate updates and reassurance.</p>
                <p><strong>Business Goal:</strong> Provide clear information to improve passenger satisfaction.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>Flight updates often feel impersonal and cold, ignoring the stress passengers feel. Simple, empathetic phrases like "Weâ€™re sorry for the delay to your flight. Please monitor airport screens or the Flight Tracker for updates" can reassure and support users during delays.</p>
                <p>By addressing emotional concerns, airlines can build trust and improve the overall passenger experience.</p>
