                <h2>Flight Delayed Messages</h2>
                <p>Airports and flight details can be confusing. In this microcopy project, I provide an example of how to be clear while using a friendly tone.</p>

                <h2>Scenario</h2>
                <p>Marco needs to pick his daughter up at the airport, but her flight is delayed. Marco doesn’t know what to do and feels stressed. He would like to know more about the condition of the flight his daughter is on.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Flight Delayed</p>
                <p><strong>User Goal:</strong> Get more information</p>
                <p><strong>Business Goal:</strong> Reduce confusion for passengers</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>Flight information is often presented in a cold and technical manner, failing to address the stress and doubts passengers may feel during delays. By adding clear and empathetic messages such as, "We’re sorry for the delay to your flight. Please continue to monitor the airport screens and check the Flight Tracker for updates," passengers feel informed, reassured, and supported.</p>
                <p>A few thoughtful words can go a long way in reducing frustration and enhancing trust in airport communication.</p>
